Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when they include a subset of ages 85-100+ because populations are not"
"available for those ages. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Ages 85-100."
"2. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"3. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Unreliable."
"4. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Not Stated."
"5. Deaths of persons with Hispanic origin ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among"
"Hispanic Origin groups, so are not included in the Hispanic Origin specific counts and rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Not Stated."
"6. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the"
"funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis"
"of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin"
"are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Racial Differences."
"7. The population figures for years 2022 and later are single-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage"
"2022 postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 22, 2023. The 2022 series is based on the Modified Blended Base"
"produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count. The Modified Blended Base consists of"
"the blend of Vintage 2020 postcensal population estimates for April 1, 2020, 2020 Demographic Analysis Estimates, and 2020"
"Census data from the internal Census Edited File (CEF). The population figures for years 2021 are single-race estimates of the"

"9. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99"
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences"
"in information available to individual states and probable errors. Deaths with the underlying cause classified with O00-O99 are"
"subject to further processing before these deaths records are considered final. Provisional deaths have not undergone full"
"processing and review and therefore should not be considered final for statistical purposes. Caution should be used in"
"interpreting these data. More information can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/maternal-mortality/."
"10. On March 11, 2021, the 2019 mortality data on CDC WONDER was updated with the 2019 mortality data updated by NCHS on March"
"4, 2021 to include corrected information for residents of Texas affecting 5 records previously coded to cause code *U01.4,"
"Terrorism involving firearms (homicide). The underlying and multiple cause of death codes for 5 records were corrected in the"
"2019 data. Underlying and multiple cause of death codes for those 5 records were recoded to Assault (homicide) by other and"
