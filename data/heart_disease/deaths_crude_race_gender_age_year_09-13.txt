Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when they include a subset of ages 85-100+ because populations are not"
"available for those ages. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Ages 85-100."

"3. Circumstances in New Jersey for the year 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code"
"R99, ""Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality"" and therefore unusually low death counts in other ICD-10 codes,"

"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Unreliable."
"6. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Not Stated."
"7. Deaths of persons with Hispanic origin ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among"

"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Not Stated."
"8. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the"
"funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis"
"of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin"
